Customized hosts file

This is a customized hosts file for myself.  It is a modified version of Steven Black's adware and malware list as of 11/23/2020.  All credit goes to Steven Black for the original list.

# hosts_proxy_sites.txt

This hosts file is a collection of proxy sites so proxy websites can be blocked.  Proxy lists are pulled from various websites
and manually added to this list.  If you see any items that should be added to this list, please let me know at pctsevens@gmail.com.
